Code for the study "Questioning the Evidence for Host-Symbiont Codiversification in Mycorrhizal Symbioses"

This repository includes the R code used to perform cophylogenetic analyses on the mycorrhizal association described in Perez 2022 and the R code used to perform cophylogenetic analyses on the mycorrhizal associations described in 12 other studies. Each code has several parts: formatting data, evaluating cophylogenetic signal by performing global-fit methods (parafit and PACo), evaluating phylogenetic congruence by performing the event-based method eMPRess (which requires to format data, to perform it in a Bash script and to recover results). Each part of the code has been applied to each mycorrhizal network.
